Turfjs-client for Meteor
========================

This package is a simple wrapper for
[Turf](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf). Manipulate GeoJSON objects,
similar to PostGIS.

Read [an introduction to Turf.js and spatial
analysis](https://www.mapbox.com/guides/intro-to-turf/).

Usage
-----

Install the package via command line:

    $ meteor add yauh:turfjs-client

**Note** `turf` is only available on the client, not on the server. If
you need it on the server install `yauh:turfjs`.

See [the official docs](http://turfjs.org/static/docs/) for the correct
syntax.
